# Splitting Vertices in 2-Layer Graph Drawings

To use this software, please click on the "code" menu and then click "Download ZIP". Please extract the folder, and open the file named "index.html" in your browser. There is a textbox on the left side. You can provide input in the textbox in Json format. In the "graphs" folder there exist some Json files. You can open any of those Json files and copy the content inside the input text. Press the "Draw" button to generate a drawing. Press the "Split" button to split some vertices and generate a crossing-free drawing. The underlying algorithm is described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10872.pdf).
